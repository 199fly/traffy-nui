Project Overview
This project is focused on converting a static HTML website into a CMS-ready Next.js site with mocked API data. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you work efficiently and integrate the CMS data.

File Structure
theme/: Contains the HTML files that need to be converted into Next.js components.
pages/api/mock-api.json: Contains the mocked CMS data, which you will use to simulate real CMS behavior during development.
pages/[...permalink].js: The root file that dynamically generates pages based on the permalink.
Setup Instructions
Install dependencies:
Run npm install to install all required dependencies.

Folder Structure:

theme/: Use the files from the theme folder and convert them into reusable components.
pages/api/mock-api.json: This file contains all the mock data that mimics a real CMS. This data drives the dynamic rendering of components.
Rendering Pages:

[...permalink].js dynamically generates pages based on the API data.
For each page, it maps through the blocks array and renders the corresponding component based on the name field.
Add New Components:

New components must be imported and added to the Render.js switch-case statement.
Example:
js
Copy code
import NewComponent from './components/NewComponent';

case 'NewComponent':
  return <NewComponent data={data} />;
getStaticPaths:
Generates static pages at build time based on the permalink for each page in the mock API.

getStaticProps:
Fetches page data based on the permalink and passes it as props to render the correct page.

How to Proceed
Convert HTML to Components:

Take each section from the theme HTML and turn it into reusable components.
Ensure that the structure of these components matches the CMS mock data fields in mock-api.json.
Component Mapping:

Map the mock API block names (like Nav1, Hero1, etc.) to the corresponding components in the Render.js file.
If a block type doesnâ€™t have a matching component, render a placeholder (already configured in Render.js).
Dynamic Data Binding:

Ensure that the components are using the data field correctly to display dynamic content.
For example, for the Nav1 component, ensure the menu items from the API are being passed and rendered as expected.
Styling:

Convert the inline styles or class-based styles from the HTML in the theme folder into CSS modules or Tailwind classes as per project conventions.
Mock API:

The mock data is stored in mock-api.json under pages/api/. Treat this as the CMS data source. You can adjust or extend it as needed during development.
Notes
Component Naming: Ensure component names in mock-api.json match the actual component names in your project.
Fallback Pages: The fallback: false in getStaticPaths ensures that only the pages specified in the mock API are generated at build time.
Good luck and feel free to ask questions if anything is unclear!

Migrating <Head> Component and Public Directory Assets
Head Component
The <Head> component in Next.js is used to manage the document head, allowing you to add meta tags, titles, links, and other head elements dynamically for each page.

Migrating Head Elements:

In the HTML files (within the theme/ folder), move all <title>, <meta>, and other head elements into the <Head> component in Next.js.
For example, if you have the following HTML in the theme:
html
Copy code
<head>
  <title>My Page</title>
  <meta name="description" content="This is a sample description">
  <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico">
</head>
Convert it to:
jsx
Copy code
<Head>
  <title>{title}</title> {/* Use dynamic titles from mock API */}
  <meta name="description" content="This is a sample description" />
  <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
</Head>
Dynamic Meta Tags:

If the mock CMS data includes meta tags or dynamic values for the head section (like global_tags), ensure to extract that data and use it within the <Head> component.
Example:
jsx
Copy code
<Head>
  <title>{title}</title>
  {global_tags.map(tag => (
    <meta key={tag.attributes.key} name={tag.attributes.key} content={tag.attributes.content} />
  ))}
</Head>
Public Directory Assets
Any assets like images, favicons, or other static files referenced in your HTML should be moved to the public/ directory in your Next.js project.

Migrating Static Files:

Move all static assets (images, videos, fonts, etc.) to the public/ directory.
Update the paths in the HTML or components to reference these files from the public/ directory. For example:
html
Copy code
<img src="/assets/logo.png" alt="Logo">
Files in the public/ directory are referenced relative to the root (/), so no need to use import for static assets.
Favicon:

Move any favicon files to public/ and update the <link rel="icon" /> tag accordingly within the <Head> component.
Example:
jsx
Copy code
<Head>
  <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
</Head>
Checklist for Migration:
Head Elements: Migrate titles, meta tags, links (e.g., favicon), and scripts into the <Head> component.
Static Files: Move all images, videos, and other static assets to the public/ directory and update references in components or HTML.
Dynamic Meta: Bind any dynamic meta tags from mock data (if applicable) inside the <Head> component.
By following these steps, you'll ensure that all head elements and static assets are properly migrated into the Next.js structure.

Project Overview
This project involves converting a static HTML website into a CMS-ready Next.js site using mocked API data. You will be working with a folder called theme that contains the HTML structure and using mock data from pages/api/mock-api.json. The goal is to dynamically generate pages using this CMS mock data, ensuring the site is ready for integration with a real CMS.

Key Directories
theme/: Contains the static HTML files you will convert to reusable Next.js components.
public/: Holds all static assets (images, icons, etc.) to be referenced within the app.
pages/api/mock-api.json: Contains mock CMS data, which will simulate the CMS behavior during development.
pages/[...permalink].js: This file dynamically generates pages based on the permalink field in the mock API.
Setup Instructions
Install dependencies:
Run the following command to install necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Folder Structure:

theme/: Use the HTML files from the theme folder as a reference and convert them into Next.js components.
pages/api/mock-api.json: This file contains mock data resembling a real CMS. You will use this data to dynamically generate pages and render components.
Rendering Pages:

[...permalink].js is responsible for dynamically generating pages based on the permalink field from the CMS mock data.
Each page consists of multiple blocks, and these blocks are mapped to specific components based on the name field.
Add New Components:

Create new components for each section of the HTML structure in theme/.
Import the new components in Render.js and map the block name from the mock API to the component.
Example of adding a new component:
js
Copy code
import NewComponent from './components/NewComponent';

case 'NewComponent':
  return <NewComponent data={data} />;
getStaticPaths:
Generates static pages during build time based on the permalink field from the mock API.

getStaticProps:
Fetches the appropriate page data for each permalink and passes it as props to render the dynamic page content.

Working with Head Component
Migrating Head Elements:

Move all <title>, <meta>, and other head elements from the HTML into the <Head> component.
For example, if the theme has:
html
Copy code
<head>
  <title>My Page</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Sample description">
  <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico">
</head>
Convert it to:
jsx
Copy code
<Head>
  <title>{title}</title> {/* Use dynamic title from mock API */}
  <meta name="description" content="Sample description" />
  <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
</Head>
Dynamic Meta Tags:

If the CMS mock data contains dynamic meta tags (like global_tags), render them inside the <Head> component.
jsx
Copy code
<Head>
  <title>{title}</title>
  {global_tags.map(tag => (
    <meta key={tag.attributes.key} name={tag.attributes.key} content={tag.attributes.content} />
  ))}
</Head>
Public Directory for Static Assets
Moving Static Files:

All static assets like images, fonts, and icons should be placed in the public/ directory.
Update image references in your components to point to the public directory. For example:
html
Copy code
<img src="/assets/logo.png" alt="Logo">
Favicon:

Move favicon files into public/ and update the <Head> component to use the correct path:
jsx
Copy code
<Head>
  <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
</Head>
Handling Images with Defaults
When rendering images from the mock API, always provide a fallback image if the image URL is not available. You can store a default image in the public/ folder and reference it whenever necessary.

Example of Image Fallback
jsx
Copy code
import React from 'react';

function ExampleComponent({ data }) {
  const defaultImage = '/assets/default-image.png'; // Path to the default image in public/

  return (
    <div>
      <img src={data.image?.value || defaultImage} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default ExampleComponent;
In this example, if the data.image.value is null or undefined, it falls back to defaultImage, ensuring that the site always displays a valid image.

Checklist for Migration
Head Elements: Migrate titles, meta tags, and favicons into the <Head> component.
Static Assets: Move all images, fonts, and other static assets into the public/ directory.
Image Fallbacks: Ensure all images use a default if the CMS data doesn't provide an image.
Components: Create reusable components based on the HTML structure in the theme folder and map them to blocks in the mock API.
Dynamic Pages: Ensure pages are dynamically generated based on the mock CMS data using getStaticPaths and getStaticProps.
Conclusion
By following this guide, youâ€™ll convert the static HTML theme into a fully dynamic Next.js website ready to be connected to a CMS. Make sure to use the mock data effectively and add fallback mechanisms (like default images) to handle missing data gracefully.
